Working with Protobuf in Golang

This repo contains the code working with Protobuf in Golang.

 Some basic conversions like,

 - Message to Bytes

 - Bytes to Message

 - Message to JSON

 - JSON to Message

 The compiled proto files (pb file) is located in my default GOPATH so the Go pb file won't be here.
